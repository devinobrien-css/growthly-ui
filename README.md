## Getting Started

To run the web application locally, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devinobrien/growthly-ui.git
```

> OR pull the repo with Github Desktop or a similar Git GUI

2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm i
```

3. **Install GitHooks:** An abstraction of this has been provided for convenience:

```bash
npm run prepare
```

```bash
npm start
```

The application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Helpful Tips

### Precommit Checks

```bash
npx husky init
```

Move the file `husky-sample/pre-commit` inside of the `.husky` directory.

By moving the pre-commit file inside the .husky directory, we have now configured your pre-commit hooks. This will prevent unlinted/untested code from being commited

### Auto Formatting Code

This application uses `prettier` and `eslint` to maintain the formatting and syntax of the codebase. In order to utilize these features without console commands, install `eslint`, `prettier`, and `eslint prettier` extensions on VSCode.

Alternatively, run:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run prettier
```

### Auditing Packages

This application uses `depcheck` to audit unused packages:

```bash
npx depcheck
```

The configuration for this audit is managed through the `.depcheckrc` file in the root of the application.

### Auditing Components

This application uses `ts-prune` to locate and remove unused components within the application.

```bash
npm run prune
```

The configuration for this file is managed through `.unimportedrc.json`
